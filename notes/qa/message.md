**Title**: I'm testing a resource for people new to Python and interested in Natural Language Processing



The [NLTK Book](https://www.nltk.org/book/) is a free online resource for learning python programming as well as the basics of natural language processing, a sub-field of data science that focuses on the processing and understanding of text.

For a senior project at my University, I wanted to create resource that helped students create a programming environment to run the code in the book and provide tips on the book's exercises. The NLTK Book and the resource I created assume no prior programming experience. 

This resource I am creating is still under construction and I'm looking for feedback for it's effectiveness as a self-learning tool. Notes for setting up the Python environment and resources for Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 are available. Check out the Setup Notebook link to see how to get started and consider submitting a survey response to help improve this resource. Thank you and I hope you find this helpful!
