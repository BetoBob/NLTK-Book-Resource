# Plan

Below is my intended approach of completing this project. At a bare minimum, I would like to have detailed solutions to each chapter's exercises and provide a setup tutorial to get learners familiar with a python environment to run the NLTK code in (steps 1-2 and some of 3). Further resources will be added to the notes of each chapter as time permits.

1. create a setup 
2. provide solutions to all book exercises while providing code example notes and solutions from chapters
   * start chapter notes by including all code snippets in the book in an easily accessible format
   * complete chapter exercises
   * create blank exercise template for students to work on their code
3. once complete, go back and make notes more readable and complete; also provide links to other resources so person learning python can expand skills (including links to data visualization libraries and beginning machine learning resources for relevant sections)
4. As earlier chapters are in their 'complete' form (both notes and solutions are in finalized), start sending out a link to the resource to students as well as beginning programmers online for feedback on the resource
5. Make necessary changes based on feedback provided

## Solutions

* the first step for each chapter will be to provide complete and verbose solutions to chapter exercises
* following the creation of the book's solutions, a blank template will be created for students to work on exercises on their own; some code will be provided if necessary

## Chapter Notes

* my intentions for the notes are to be identical to the book's code, just in Jupyter notebooks so it's an easily runnable format so learners can easily manipulate the code
  * the code should be pretty legible and organized, and small notes next to the code would be nice to supplement the code (perhaps give more context to what certain syntax is doing)
  * my intention isn't to rewrite the book, but to provide more context in areas that might not be detailed enough and provide an environment that is easy to program in
* content to add to the notes at the top can include:
  * a list of functions used throughout the chapter (a sort of cheat sheet for doing exercises)
  * links to other helpful resources 
  * this will be a stretch goal; the highest priority will be providing adequate solutions for the chapters
* a separate notebook will be provided to help the user get started with using the notes and exercise modules in general
  * this will give an overview of how to install and use python, Jupyter Notebooks and Markdown
  * this will also provide resource for learning very basic syntax for python if the book's  
* think about whether or not output should be shown by default or if all output should be cleared in these notes
  * might be nice to have it clear so readers can run the code in real time
  * output is already shown in the textbook; the purpose of having it in the notebook is to modify the code or to see it run in real time (to actually do it)

## To-Do

* create an introduction in README to 
* create table of contents in the README
* create a cheatsheet for various NLTK library calls?
  * potentially include this in the beginning of each chapter notes to help people learning NLTK
* learn more about GitHub issue tracking
* find a way in google colab to more quickly download NLTK book resources
  *  current method: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49085673/download-all-nltk-packages-in-google-colaboratory-at-once
  * `nltk.download('book')`

### Project Logistics

* find the expected completion date of this project
* verify that the project has been approved by the CSC Department

### Feedback

* ask online initially to see what people would be interested in having in a natural language processing resource
  * ask in online forum posts potentially
* see if any humanities professors in the school would be interested in learning from this project
  * look into what contact options are available within the college of humanities

### Chapter Specific

#### Setup

* create a setup notebook that covers how to install Jupyter (or alternatively how to use Google Colab), downloading the NLTK python library, downloading the corpus required for the example exercises

* at this point, also include an extra tutorial or resource for learning the fundamentals of python programming
  * while Chapter 1 is helpful for learning python programming in the context of NLP, it can be a bit jarring to be shown all these new programming concepts initially 
* also include brief tutorial on markdown notes
