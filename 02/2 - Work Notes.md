# 2 - Work Notes

* I would like to make a list of resources at the top of the page
  * particularly, each NLTK resource that is introduced in the text, and perhaps their corresponding functions
  * potentially do this on a second run-through of the notes to avoid context switching

## Notes

### 1.7 Other Languages (UDHR)

* [check this stack overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/64019113/12578069) to see if someone found a solution to this problem

### 1.9

* verify that the import corpus example works on google colab
  * I'm assuming the whole master repository's contents are included in colab
* include an example of downloading a free corpus 
  * probably the most relevant would be [anc](http://www.anc.org/data/masc/downloads/data-download/)
  * only add code for this if it becomes relevant in later questions / chapters

### 2.3

* maybe make a `ConditionalProbDist` as an extra example

#### 4.1
