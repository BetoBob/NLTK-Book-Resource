# Chapter 3 Notes

* check if `pprint` library is used in the future or just a part of Python 2 requirements
* possibly include a link about the python library Selenium?

## 3.1

* look into doing a proper example of search engine results,  specifically for the **Your Turn** question
  * preferably not using a paid API like Google or Bing
  * Duck Duck Go does not work for the **Your Turn** example because [it does not show the number of search results](https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/results/number-of-results/)

* consider adding example for extracting text from a PDF if time permits

## Exercises

* try to make better formatting for 6-7, 23-24 lettered lists
