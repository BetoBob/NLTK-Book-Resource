# Supplemental

These are a list of supplemental topics to cover potentially in this resource, specifically for:

* concepts used a lot in the book that can be conceptually challenging to understand
* the technology used in to run the resources (i.e. Jupyter Notebooks)

Might want to include links at the beginning of the program for each of the concepts; creating a sort of table of contents for material students might find challenging learning through just this course.

## List

* **List Comprehensions (these are used frequently)**
  * I definitely need some tutorial on this; it can be a confusing concept and the book uses them heavily
* Dictionaries
* Matplotlib (at least the helper functions)
* Jupyter Notebooks
  * how to run kernel properly
  * how variables are stored through each execution of code
* importing libraries

### Stretch

* Git
