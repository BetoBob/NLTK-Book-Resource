# Plan

1. provide solutions to all book exercises while providing initial notes from chapters
   * I generally want to complete the solutions and rough drafts of my notes first so I can get a better idea of what python skills I should focus in on exploring in extra detail
2. once complete, go back and make notes more readable and complete; also provide links to other resources so person learning python can expand skills (including links to data visualization libraries and beginning machine learning resources for relevant sections)
3. As earlier chapters are in their 'complete' form (both notes and solutions are in finalized), start sending out a link to the resource to students as well as beginning programmers online for feedback on the resource
4. Make necessary changes based on feedback provided

## To-Do

* create an introduction in README to 
* create table of contents in the README
* create a cheatsheet for various NLTK library calls?
  * potentially include this in the beginning of each chapter notes to help people learning NLTK
* learn more about GitHub issue tracking 

## Project Logistics

* find the expected completion date of this project
* verify that the project is 

### Feedback

* ask online initially to see what people would be interested in having in a natural language processing resource
  * ask in online forum posts potentially
* see if any humanities professors in the school would be interested in learning from this project
  * look into what contact options are available within the college of humanities

### Chapter Specific

#### Setup

* create a setup notebook that covers how to install Jupyter (or alternatively how to use Google Colab), downloading the NLTK python library, downloading the corpus required for the example exercises

* at this point, also include an extra tutorial or resource for learning the fundamentals of python programming
  * while Chapter 1 is helpful for learning python programming in the context of NLP, it can be a bit jarring to be shown all these new programming concepts initially 
* also include brief tutorial on markdown notes
