## Resources

Another excellent introductory Python resource is Kaggle courses. Kaggle is a data science competition site run by Google. Competitors and learners share Jupyter Notebooks with predictive algorithms, typically using machine learning, data visualization and data cleaning techniques. Kaggle Courses offers free Data Science lessons in a Jupyter Notebook format, and assumes no prior python programming experience.
