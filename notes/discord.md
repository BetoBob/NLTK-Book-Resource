This Discord server aims to be a place to discuss concepts and exercises in the NLTK Book. The structure of this server is based off the ISL Study Group Discord server. There is a channel for each Chapter in the book to discuss NLP concepts, and additional channels for NLP specific or Python specific questions.

I am also creating a book resource to accompany the NLTK book. This is a repository that aims to get users new to Python up and running in a Data Science environment to write and run code. In addition to a setup tutorial for Jupyter Notebooks, the resource also provides a place to run example code in the book as well as exercises / selected solutions from the book. If you'd like to improve the repository or have any questions / suggestions about it, add a message in the #nltk-book-resource channel.
