## About

This repository is intended to be a starting point for students wanting to learn both Natural Language Processing concepts and the Python programming language using the NLTK book. [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) is short for "Natural Language Toolkit", a set of linguistic tools used to analyze text for educational and research purposes. The [NLTK book](https://www.nltk.org/book/) aims to teach users common Natural Language Processing concepts and Python 3.0 simultaneously. The book also introduces other important concepts to general programming and Data Science, including:

* data collection
* data manipulation
* data structures
* machine learning
* readable structured program writing

This repository will teach students how to set up an environment to run python code for learning NLTK and to learn more Data Science concepts in the future. Each chapter of the NLTK book has a set of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) that includes:

1. a **Notes and Examples** notebook with runnable code from examples provided in the book

2. an **Exercises** notebook to work on course material

3. selected **Exercise Solutions** to review challenging material

The [Initial Setup Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/BetoBob/NLTK-Book-Resource/blob/master/setup.ipynb) explains how to run and save these notebooks. It's intended students use the **Notes and Examples** page as they read the text to understand how the python code is run, and to edit python code to have a better conceptual understanding of what the code is doing. Tips and references to modern resources such as datasets, Python libraries, APIs and tutorials will be given throughout these notes as well. Students are also encouraged to try the chapter exercises in the **Exercises** notebook, and use the **Exercise Solutions** notebooks to understand more challenging problems.

This repository is currently under construction. Content for new chapters will be added throughout the year.
