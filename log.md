# Work Log

* Committing 15-20 hours per week on this project
  * might reduce hours per week during Thanksgiving break depending on my progress with the project's completion
* by the end of each week, I will have wanted to complete a significant amount of work for the corresponding chapter in the NLTK book (there are 12 chapters in total)
  * at a bare minimum, all solutions to challenge problems should be provided in the chapter at this point
